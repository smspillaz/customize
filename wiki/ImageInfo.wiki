#labels Featured
If you are creating your own images you'd probably like to know what size they should be.  That is what this list seeks to provide.

== Naming Notes ==
Image names cannot contain dashes "-" other than to group two images together in a set, ie. CarrierImages.  The dash has a special meaning and will break if used other than what it is intended for.

== Carrier Images ==
Height: 20px
Width: Variable as needed
Resolution: 72ppi

Notes: Save the image that will look good on a black background as mycarrier.png, and the one that looks good on white background as mycarrier-1.png.

== Badge Images ==
Height: 30px
Width: 29px
Res: 72ppi
