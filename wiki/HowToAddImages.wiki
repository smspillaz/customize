I have been making some carrier images to upload using iShare from 
Sharescape so I thought i would share some and also give a basic tutorial 
on how i do it, also refer to the customize images tutorial for creating 
the images. find an image you want to use, go to sendscape at 
http://fs09u.sendspace.com/processupload.html
and go to upload. then choose your file and agree to the terma and click 
upload.
wait for it to give you the url,
then on your iPhone go to iShare and go to download,
you then type in the file name and tap next,
then you will need to locate the customize image folder by tapping the 
Home button at the top,
then tapping Library,
then Customize, 
then select the folder you want to put it under(ex. carrier image, slider, 
wifi, ect..)
now if there's a designer folder, select that folder,
but if not, I have been using the Default folder
hit select, and you're done!
just go to Customize on the main screen and your images will be there!
