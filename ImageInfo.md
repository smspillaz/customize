If you are creating your own images you'd probably like to know what size they should be.  That is what this list seeks to provide.

## Naming Notes ##
Image names cannot contain dashes "-" other than to group two images together in a set, ie. CarrierImages below.  The dash has a special meaning and will break if used other than what it is intended for.

## Dock Background Images ##
Width: 320px
Height: 91px

## Carrier Images ##
Width: Variable as needed
Height: 20px

Notes: Save the image that will look good on a black background as mycarrier.png, and the one that looks good on white background as mycarrier-1.png.  I have had good results using Arial font for this graphic.

## WiFi Images ##
Width: 20px
Height: 20px

Notes:  The WiFi image set consists of 8 images as follows:

| Your File Name | Description | Intended Background Color |
|:---------------|:------------|:--------------------------|
| yourfile.png | No Signal | White |
| yourfile-1.png | one "bar" | White |
| yourfile-2.png | two "bars" | White |
| yourfile-3.png | full "bars" | White |
| yourfile-4.png | No Signal | Black |
| yourfile-5.png | one "bar" | Black |
| yourifle-6.png | two "bars" | Black |
| yourfile-7.png | full "bars" | Black |


## Badge Images ##
Width: 29px
Height: 30px

## Bar Dialer Image ##
See [This Tutorial](http://www.hacktheiphone.com/iphone_change_keypad_background_image.html) for information on how to create a custom keypad dialer.

## Battery Images ##
Width: 264px
Height: 129px

Notes: The battery image set consists of 17 images, named yourname.png, yourname-1.png, ..., yourname-16.png.  Because I think it would look better (you'll see) yourname.png is _actually_ the 17th image, and all the other numbers correspond.

## Sound Images ##
Width: 87px
Height: 88px

## Chat Balloons ##
Width: 43px
Height: 32px

## Slider Images ##
Width: 70px
Height: 47px

Notes: The sound image set consists of four images whose names are described here:

| yourname.png | Ring Image |
|:-------------|:-----------|
| yourname-1.png | Mute Image |
| yourname-2.png | Silent Image |
| yourname-3.png | Speaker Image |
