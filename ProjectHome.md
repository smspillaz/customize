**26 March 2009**

Work on the re-authentication bug is underway.  Stay tuned for updates.  If you are a developer and interested in re-envisioning the Customize app please email me at my gmail, username is thespicychicken.

In the mean time, check out my new project and new apps at http://mophilia.com.

**22 March 2009**

Because of extremely limited time and a resilient interest in keeping Customize alive from all of you, I have decied that Customize 2.0 will also become open source.  I am releasing it this way in hopes that there are some developers who would like to continue development, take in a new direction, whatever.  I will continue to maintain a server that will host theme files as long as it is required by future incarnation of Customize.

**5 May 2008**

Customize 2.0 is public and available through Installer and soon Cydia.  All older versions of Customize will no longer be supported.  It is recommended that you upgrade to 2.0 as soon as possible.  Visit http://customizeapp.com for more information.

**19 Mar 2008**

Customize 2.0 is moving forward.  Check out the progress at http://customize.thespicychicken.com.

**17 Mar 2008**

For those on 1.1.3 and 1.1.4: This new version will make all of your dreams come true ;-)  However, it's not ready yet, so in the mean time, check out what these other people have done (Thanks to everyone who contributed to these pages!):

Progress on Customize 2.0 has been great!  I have rewritten most of the core software to make Customize a MUCH more reliable program.  I also am working on a companion website that's going to make Customizing your iPhone a dream come true!

BUT, I just had a sobering conversation with Ste (who rocks it out, by the way).  He has advised me that I need some serious hosting.  As I am only a college student, I can't quite work it into my budget.  If you or someone you know wants to sponsor some serious hosting services, please email me at thespicychicken@gmail.com.

(from thespicychicken.com)

The SDK is out and it's ON. I'm going to go at this full throttle as soon as I get back from a little road trip. The new customize will be out next week, probably. I'm going to have it do everything I can think of making it do, so if you have some requests for features, email me with "Customize Feature Request" in the subject (thespicychicken@gmail.com).

Also, Customize is going to remain freely distributed software through Installer, however, if I choose to distribute through iTunes there may be a $1 charge.

Let's have some fun! -SC

**15 Oct 2007**
Customize does not currently work with iPod Touch.

**14 Oct 2007**
The iPod issue has been fixed for 1.0.2 and 1.1.1 now, really. :-)

If you know Objective-C and would like to help out with making Customize perfect, please email me at thespicychicken@gmail.com.

**13 Oct 2007**
Fixed iPod bug.

**12 Oct 2007**
Version 1.11 (huh, how coincidental) will run on 1.1.1 and now rSBT has been rolled into Customize.  It is Universally compatible, so it is safe to run on both 1.0.2 and 1.1.1.  See Development Blog (at right) for more info.

Special thanks to Shai!! For all his help on version 1.11 adding extra image swapping features.

Enjoy!

PS. Customize may crash the first time your run it.  Run it again and it should start up.  I'm working on this.
